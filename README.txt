University of Johannesburg Branch
=================================

	This branch includes a number of modifications to the VPL plugin to
	implement a Specifications Grading system for the introductory
	programming course in the Faculty of Engineering and the Built Envionment
	at UJ. The modifications include the following:

	* Allow questions to be labelled as separate outcomes.
	* Allow questions to be labelled as having a certain completion level.
	* Restrict access to question to student who are booked for a given session
	  using the Reservation plugin.
	* Restrict access to questions of levels above a students current completion level.
	* Randomly assign questions to students in subsequent sessions without repeatition.
